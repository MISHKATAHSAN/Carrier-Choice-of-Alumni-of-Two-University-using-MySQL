# Carrier-Choice-of-Alumni-of-Two-University-using-MySQL


# Alumni Career Analysis using MySQL

**Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing the career choices of alumni from two universities, College A and College B. Understanding the career paths of alumni is crucial for evaluating the success and impact of the institutions. By analyzing data related to alumni career choices, we aim to gain insights into trends, preferences, and patterns that can inform decision-making and strategic initiatives.


**Dataset**

The dataset consists of six CSV files, each containing records of alumni from College A and College B:

•	College_A_HS: Higher Studies Record of College A

•	College_A_SE: Self Employed Record of College A

•	College_A_SJ: Service/Job Record of College A

•	College_B_HS: Higher Studies Record of College B

•	College_B_SE: Self-Employed Record of College B

•	College_B_SJ: Service/Job Record of College B


**Tasks**


1.	Schema Creation: Create a new schema named alumni.

2.	Data Import: Import all .csv files into MySQL.

3.	Table Structure: View the structure of the six tables.

4.	Data Display with Python: Display the first 1000 rows of tables using Python in a Jupyter notebook.

5.	Excel Import: Import all records of tables into MS Excel.

6.	Data Cleaning - College_A_HS: Perform data cleaning on College_A_HS table and store cleaned data in view College_A_HS_V by removing null values.

7.	Data Cleaning - College_A_SE: Perform data cleaning on College_A_SE table and store cleaned data in view College_A_SE_V by removing null values.

8.	Data Cleaning - College_A_SJ: Perform data cleaning on College_A_SJ table and store cleaned data in view College_A_SJ_V by removing null values.

9.	Data Cleaning - College_B_HS: Perform data cleaning on College_B_HS table and store cleaned data in view College_B_HS_V by removing null values.

10.	Data Cleaning - College_B_SE: Perform data cleaning on College_B_SE table and store cleaned data in view College_B_SE_V by removing null values.

11.	Data Cleaning - College_B_SJ: Perform data cleaning on College_B_SJ table and store cleaned data in view College_B_SJ_V by removing null values.

12.	Procedure for String Conversion: Create a procedure to convert Name, FatherName, and MotherName records into lowercase for all views.

13.	Excel Pivot Chart: Import the created views into MS Excel and create a pivot chart for the location of alumni.

14.	Procedure - Get Names for College A: Write a query to create a procedure using cursor to fetch names of all students from College A.

15.	Procedure - Get Names for College B: Write a query to create a procedure using cursor to fetch names of all students from College B.

16.	Percentage Calculation: Calculate the percentage of career choices (Higher Studies, Self Employed, Service/Job) for College A and College B alumni.

    
# **How to Run the Project**


1.	Database Setup: Create a MySQL database and schema named alumni.

2.	Data Import: Import the provided .csv files into MySQL using MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client.

3.	SQL Execution: Execute the SQL commands provided for each task in MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client.

4.	Python Data Display: Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the Python code to display data from the tables.

5.	Excel Import: Import the records from tables into MS Excel for further analysis and visualization.

6.	Data Cleaning: Execute the SQL commands for data cleaning and creating views.

7.	Procedure Creation: Execute the SQL queries to create procedures for fetching student names.

8.	Excel Pivot Chart: Import the created views into MS Excel and create pivot charts for analysis.

9.	Percentage Calculation: Execute the SQL query to calculate the percentage of career choices for College A and College B alumni.

    
**Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of alumni career choices for two universities. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and analysis, along with Python and Excel for data visualization, valuable insights can be gained into the career trajectories of alumni from different educational institutions.
